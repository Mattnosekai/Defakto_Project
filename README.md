# Defakto Project

ASP.NET & C# Candidate Test from 2013. 

# To run the app:
In Visual Studio, lanuch project with IIS instance. This is viewable in a browser on localhost.
VS will pop up with a browser window to render the page.

Before running this, remember to attach the database files and connect Visual Studio to the local SQL Server Express Instance. 
Attach the database to SQL Server Express. 

The database files are:
Defakto.mdf
Defakto_log.mdf

# Original Requirements from February 11th 2013:

Attached you will find a sample web page project. There are two parts of this project:

·             Front End development: Using HTML and CSS to layout the web page.

·             Back End development: The web page has a form.  We want to save the data to a database.

You’re free to use any resources (internet, books, etc.) you need to complete the sample project. Ideally, we would like this built using ASP.Net C# and a SQL Server 2008 R2 Express database. 
Included is a PDF of what the web page should look like, along with a basic style guide. The images folder already contains the slices needed from the design to build the landing page. 
However, we’ve also included a layered PNG and a PSD file should you need it.

Requirements - Your test is to layout this landing page using HTML and CSS. At minimum, the following should be met:

·         HTML markup should not contain any inline styles, only classes or ids.

·         All CSS styles should be contained in a separate CSS file.

·         Validate the form.  All fields should contain a value. You may use javascript or Asp.Net Validation controls.

·         If a field is not filled out, prompt the user with a message stating which field was not filled out.

·         When a user submits the form, the form fields should be saved to a database table.

·         Present the user with a simple “Thank you for submitting the form” page.

Please complete this test project to the best of your abilities and provide back a zipped archive of your code and a backup of your database.

Again, let us know if you have any questions, or need anything to help build this project (tools, etc).

Thank you so much and I look forward to hearing back from you!
